# Tic-Tac-Toe
This classic Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game alternates turns, with each player selecting a cell to place their markâ€”either "X" or "O." The objective is to be the first to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
